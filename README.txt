DreamMachineTopMostRemover for "The Dream Machine" for Windows
==
This applications runs in the background and removes the "Top Most" flag on the game Window of "The Dream Machine". "The Dream Machine" is a lovely game (check it out if you haven't!), but it forces its Window as topmost, making it impossible to switch to other Windows while the game is running, which is annoying and inconvenient beyond words. Running this application makes it possible to have "The Dream Machine" run in the background while checking mail, surfing the web or doing whatever else one wants to quickly do during the game without closing the game. This is especially useful during one of the many long dialogs, where saving the game isn't possible.

I was lazy, there is no GUI and the only way to terminate the application is by killing it with the Windows task manager.
